Youtube endlessly recommend the next video when the video played. The next video become unrelated with the very first video when the recommendation keep repeated. When the video which had been already shown before is recommended, the next video chain will be stopped at the screen. The user can search their own keyword and test the visualization of the recommended next video chain. The first result of the search keyword located close to the starting point and moves farther when the recommendation chain depth is deeper. If the video is recommended several times, the nodes will be overlaped. The data of the search keyword's results and their recommended next videos has been crawled with Ruby and visualized by p5.js.
